# Chat with friend-system

Used in this project:
1. TypeScript
2. Next.js
3. Express.js
4. Awilix
5. Awilix-express
6. Socket.IO
7. SASS (7-1 pattern)

Install it and set database in `ormconfig.json`, and create DB on your server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Once you see the welcome page, you might register and then login. Friend system works, but not every functionality reflected on front-end. Currently implemented only main chat without private chats.
For second user you can open incognito tab and login there too.
